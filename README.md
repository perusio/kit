# KIT

[Kit](http://drupal.org/project/kit) is a compilation of tools and
best practices for site builders.

Kit is not actually a library of tools like for instance
[Chaos Tools](http://drupal.org/project/ctools), it is a collection of
modules and themes together with a set of guidelines that facilitate
site building. The goal is to offer a straightforward base package for
building state-of-the-art Drupal sites while specifying how Features
built on top of Kit can be compatible.
