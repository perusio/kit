# KIT

Kit is a compilation of tools and best practices for site builders.

Kit is not actually a library of tools like for instance Chaos Tools [1], it is
a collection of modules and themes together with a set of guidelines that
facilitate site building. The goal is to offer a straightforward base package
for building state-of-the-art Drupal sites while specifying how Features built
on top of Kit can be compatible.
